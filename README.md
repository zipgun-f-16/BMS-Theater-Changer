AHK Utility to change Falcon BMS theaters prior to launching BMS:

Existing Falcon BMS implementations require a lengthy 2-step process to change theaters - 1) Run BMS and change the theater & 2) Close and restart BMS to use the new theater.  

This utility speeds the operation by changing the theater before entering BMS, saving a few minutes of your spare time.

Run the utility

o It will show the current theater

o Double click the desired theater - It will ask permission to change your BMS registry 

o The table will reload and you can confirm your new setting prior to closing

This utility has only been tested on 64 bit installations
